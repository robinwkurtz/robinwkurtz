### Oh Hi ðŸ‘‹

You can call me Robin Des Bois or simply Robin, I'm from Montreal, Quebec Canada.

Professionally, I am heading up R&D with Boston Dynamics' Spot over at [Osedea](https://github.com/Osedea) with a fantastic set of other human beings. Aside from saying I play with a Robot all day, I contribute to the culture here at Osedea and help the team grow where I can. 

If you're looking for work, whether it be as a software developer, designer, project manager or the like, I encourage you to take a look at our [careers page](https://www.osedea.com/en/careers). Not only are we strong and produce great work, we also have an amazing set of benefits that helps motivate our hard work and success.

Outside of work, I enjoy 3D modelling, printing, DIY and cooking!
